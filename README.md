# Chemical-Reaction-GUI-Application
## Description

This GUI application is designed to help users visualize and understand chemical reactions. It allows for the input of reactants, their coefficients in the reaction, and their initial quantities. The program calculates the limiting reactant, the final quantities of all substances, and provides a dynamic representation of the reaction process through a series of images.

## Features

- Input fields for reactants, coefficients, and initial quantities
- Calculation of limiting reactant and quantities at equilibrium
- Dynamic image representation of the chemical reaction
- User-friendly interface built with Tkinter

## Installation

To run this application, you will need Python installed on your system. If you do not have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, you must install the PIL library, which can be done through pip:

```
pip install Pillow
pip install tk
```

Ensure that all the required images for the dynamic representation are located in the `images` directory within the same directory as the script.

## Usage

To start the application, run the script from your terminal or command prompt:

```
python chemical_reaction_gui.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to input the chemical species, their coefficients, and initial quantities. The application will guide you through each step of the input process.
